📊 Zepto SQL Data Analysis Project:

📌 Project Overview:
This project showcases my SQL skills by performing real-world data analysis on a structured dataset. The goal is to clean data, analyze patterns, and extract meaningful business insights using SQL.
This project is part of my journey to become a Data Analyst and strengthen my problem-solving skills with SQL.

🎯 Objectives:
Practice real-world SQL queries
Perform data cleaning and transformation
Analyze trends and patterns
Generate business insights from raw data

🛠 Tools & Technologies
SQL/PostgreSQL
Git & GitHub

📂 Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Zepto Inventory Dataset
Dataset SOurce: kaggle
Description:
The dataset contains information about:
Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

name: Product name as it appears on the app

category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

weightInGms: Product weight in grams

outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

🔧 Project Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);

2. Data Import
Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

3. 🔍 Data Exploration
Counted the total number of records in the dataset

Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

Checked for null values across all columns

Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

5. 📊 Business Insights
Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

Estimated potential revenue for each product category

Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

Measured total inventory weight per product category
